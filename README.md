# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project implements a Linear Regression model to estimate house sale prices using a subset of key housing features. It serves as a foundational example of how to approach regression problems using Python's data science ecosystem.

## Dataset

The dataset used is from the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) competition. It includes comprehensive data on residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

- Dataset file required: `train.csv`
- Download link: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

Please download the dataset manually from Kaggle and upload it in the notebook environment when prompted.

## Features Used

The model utilizes the following features from the dataset:

- `GrLivArea`: Above ground living area (square feet)
- `BedroomAbvGr`: Number of bedrooms above ground
- `FullBath`: Number of full bathrooms

## How to Run

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Copy and paste the full Python code from this repository into a new Colab notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. When prompted, upload the `train.csv` file obtained from Kaggle

## Output

The notebook will:
- Train a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
- Output key evaluation metrics such as R² Score and RMSE
- Generate a scatter plot comparing actual vs predicted house prices

## Dependencies

The notebook is designed to run in Google Colab, which provides all required packages by default. The libraries used include:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

If running locally, ensure these packages are installed using pip or conda.

## Author

This project was developed as an educational example of applying supervised learning techniques to a real-world regression problem using structured data.
